## Security

### Security Architecture

- **PIN-Protected Credentials** - AES-256 encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation
- **Module Whitelisting** - SHA256 manifest prevents unauthorized module loading
- **TLS 1.2+ Enforcement** - All HTTPS connections use modern TLS
- **Command Injection Prevention** - Array-based argument passing
- **Brute-Force Protection** - Exponential backoff on failed PIN attempts (3s, 6s, 9s)
- **Session Logging** - All operations logged with timestamps

### Credential Caching

Cached credentials are:
- **Encrypted** with AES-256 using PIN-derived key
- **Protected** by 10,000 PBKDF2 iterations
- **Time-limited** - PIN re-verification after 15 minutes
- **Lockout** - 3 failed attempts = session lockout
- **Clipboard auto-clear** - 30 seconds after password copy

### Update Security

- **SHA256 verification** for downloaded updates
- **HTTPS-only downloads** - HTTP URLs rejected
- **Integrity checks** - File count and syntax validation
- **Automatic rollback** on security failures

See [SECURITY-FIXES.md](SECURITY-FIXES.md) for complete security audit report.
