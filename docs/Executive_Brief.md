# RushResolve: Field Services Toolkit
**Executive Brief | Rush University Medical Center IT**

---

## The Story: A Day in the Life

It's 9 AM. A nurse at the cardiac unit calls the help desk: "The printer isn't working."

Our field tech arrives, troubleshoots the issue, and realizes they need to reinstall the printer. What should take 5 minutes turns into 20:
- Open one tool to find the print server
- Switch to another tool to install the printer
- Open a third tool to set it as default
- Go back to the first tool to print a test page

By 10 AM, they've handled three more calls—each requiring this same dance between different applications. By noon, they're exhausted from context-switching, and they still have eight tickets in their queue.

**This isn't a printer problem. It's a workflow problem.**

And it's costing us time, consistency, and quality across all 17 of our field service technicians.

## The Problem: Hidden Costs of Fragmented Tools

### 1. Time Lost to Tool-Hopping
Our techs spend an estimated **15-20 minutes per ticket** just navigating between different applications. That's not solving problems—that's *finding* the tools to solve problems.

**Math:** 17 techs × 10 tickets/day × 15 minutes wasted = **42 hours lost per week** to tool-switching alone.

### 2. The "17 Different Ways" Problem
When a computer can't connect to the network, ask any of our 17 techs what they'd do first. You'll get 17 different answers:
- Some reboot immediately
- Some check cables
- Some reset network settings
- Some call escalation right away

**Result:** Wildly inconsistent service quality. What works depends on *who* shows up, not *what* the problem is.

### 3. New Techs Take Months to Get Up to Speed
Training a new field tech currently requires:
- 2-4 weeks of shadowing experienced staff
- Learning "tribal knowledge" that only exists in veterans' heads
- Memorizing where to find each tool and how to use it
- Understanding Rush-specific configurations through trial and error

**Impact:** New hires aren't fully productive for 3-4 months, and experienced techs lose productivity while training them.

## The Solution: One Tool, One Workflow

**RushResolve** consolidates the most common field service tasks into a single, standardized application.

Instead of opening five different tools, our techs open one. Instead of 17 different approaches, everyone follows the same proven workflow.

### What It Does (In Plain English)
RushResolve handles the routine tasks that consume 80% of field service time:
- Installing and troubleshooting printers
- Diagnosing computer health issues
- Reconnecting computers to the network
- Checking system status and performance
- Cleaning up disk space safely

Everything runs through **one interface** with **step-by-step workflows** that guide techs through the right process, every time.

### Why It Matters
**For Field Techs:** Less frustration, faster ticket resolution, clear guidance on what to do next

**For Managers:** Predictable service quality, easier performance tracking, faster onboarding

**For IT Leadership:** Standardized processes, audit trails, and a platform for future automation

## The Business Case: What We Gain

### Immediate Impact (Months 1-3)
- **Faster Ticket Resolution** - Estimated 15-20% reduction in time per ticket by eliminating tool-switching
- **Consistent Service Quality** - Every tech follows the same process, reducing repeat visits and escalations
- **Onboarding Acceleration** - New techs productive in 2-3 weeks instead of 3-4 months
- **Full Audit Trail** - Every action logged automatically for accountability and troubleshooting

### Strategic Value (Months 4+)
RushResolve becomes a **platform for IT-wide efficiency**:

When Cybersecurity needs to ensure every computer has encryption enabled, we don't have to train 17 techs on a new manual process. We build the check directly into RushResolve—one update, instant deployment, consistent execution.

When End-User Technologies needs to standardize software installation, we integrate it into the same tool field techs already use every day.

**Translation:** What starts as a field services tool becomes IT's **fast lane for operationalizing new initiatives** across the organization.

## What Makes It Safe

Three questions executives always ask:

**1. "Is it secure?"**
- Every action is logged automatically (full audit trail)
- No external software or downloads required
- Cybersecurity team has full access to review all code
- No patient data is accessed—system administration only

**2. "What if something goes wrong?"**
- Built-in safety checks prevent destructive actions
- All changes are reversible
- Operates with the same permissions our techs already have—no elevation

**3. "Who maintains it?"**
- Currently maintained by Field Services (Luis Arauz)
- Open to departmental ownership transition if preferred
- All documentation and source code available for review

---

## What I'm Proposing

I'd like to deploy RushResolve to our field service team after a security review and pilot phase.

**What this needs:**
1. **Approval** to proceed with pilot deployment (5 techs, 2 weeks)
2. **Cybersecurity coordination** for code review and security validation
3. **Support for future collaboration** with other IT departments as this evolves into a broader efficiency platform

---

## The Path Forward

### Phase 1: Security Review (1-2 weeks)
Cybersecurity team reviews code, validates security model, provides feedback

### Phase 2: Pilot (2 weeks)
5 field techs use RushResolve in production, gather feedback, measure impact

### Phase 3: Full Rollout (1 week)
Deploy to all 17 techs, monitor adoption, refine based on real-world use

### Phase 4: Future Enhancement (Ongoing)
Partner with other IT departments to identify automation opportunities

---

## Why Now

Our field services team is functioning, but not optimally. Every day we delay is another day we lose hours to inefficient workflows, inconsistent service, and training overhead.

RushResolve is ready—built, tested, and refined based on real field tech needs. I believe this is an opportunity to give our team the tools they need to work smarter, and I'm ready to demonstrate how it works in practice.
